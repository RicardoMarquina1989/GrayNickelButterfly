# Description
- Project: ORCA CLMM Position Manager
- Description: ORCA offers CLMM positions to create, close, gather fees and other functionality. The tool has to be able to open positions, close, check and gather fees.
- Language: Python
- Libraries: anchorpy, solana, solders
- Excluded: No Typescript/Javascript or random SDK.

## Details:

- Tool runs on the commandline only, no other frontend needed

### Operations for ORCA CLMM:
- Opening a local wallet .json file
- Choose ORCA CLMM, Open Position, lower, upper ends - Note: PoolID, Token0, Token1 have to be gathered, as well as distribution with lower/upper ends
- Close Positions
- Check fees, how much fees have a position earned
- Collect Fees, collect the earned fees and transer to the owner wallet

### Workflow:
- You get access to a private git account, please share your github id so we can invite you
- We expect every 24h an update of the work and the progress, two/three short bulletpoints are enough
- If you have spent time to research, share the research topic and your results
 -> create md/txt files and push to the repo or create wiki in the private repo
- Upload all generated relevant code to the private git
- We will only release money if before-hand defined milestones are completed
- We will not pay any upfront money

NOTE: The script must work on the blockchain. In-depth experience with solana.py, solders, anchorpy understanding of Solana IDLs, Instructions, Accounts is *mandatory*. 
As well as in-depth knowledge of the Solana blockchain itself.

Do only take this project if you have understood 100% what the goals are and how to implement it. If you are looking for simply using a random SDK do *not* apply.
TypeScript/JavaScript are not an option.

If you are interested in making this project possible, please send an overview of your experience in Solana Blockchain, as well as an implementation plan and your time and price estimations.
